# Number Guessing Game
This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification. It demonstrates the integration of a Bash script with a PostgreSQL database, simulating a number guessing game while tracking user performance. The project showcases my skills in database interaction, data persistence, and version control using Git.

# Features
- **User Management:** Tracks new and returning users by storing usernames and game statistics in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Game Logic:** Implements a guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 1000.
- **Data Persistence:** Game results, including the number of attempts and the secret number, are stored in a relational database.
- **Database Design:** Includes a users table for player information and a games table to record each gameâ€™s result.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures valid input for each guess and provides feedback if the guess is incorrect.

## Tech Stack
<li><strong>Bash Scripting:</strong> Automates the game logic and interactions.</li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Stores user data and game statistics in relational tables.</li>
<li><strong>Git:</strong> Managed version control throughout development.</li>
