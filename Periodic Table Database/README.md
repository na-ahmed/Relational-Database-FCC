# Periodic Table Database
This project, part of FreeCodeCamp’s Relational Database certification, demonstrates my skills in SQL, PostgreSQL, and bash scripting. The database stores few elements from the periodic table, along with their properties and types.

## Features
**Database Design:** Three tables—`elements`, `properties`, `types`—with foreign key relationships and constraints for data integrity.
**Data Retrieval:** The `element.sh` script queries elements by atomic number, name, or symbol, returning key details like mass, melting/boiling points, and type.
**Database Maintenance:** The `fix_database.sh` script automates schema modifications and cleanup tasks.

## Tech Stack
**PostgreSQL:** For relational database management.<br>
**Bash:** For scripting database queries and updates.

## Skills learned
<li>Experience in designing and maintaining relational databases.</li>
<li>Automating data processes using bash scripts.</li>
<li>Writing optimized SQL queries to handle data efficiently.</li>

## Usage
1. Run `periodic_table.sql` to set up the database.
2. Use `element.sh` to query elements.
3. Use `fix_database.sh` for maintenance.
